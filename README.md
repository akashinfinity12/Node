# Node JS

This repository contains the code that I'm writing currently by learning Node.js and building RESTful APIs. I am learning to use Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests, and using MongoDB for storing and querying data. I am also learning to authenticate and authorize users using JSON Web Tokens.
